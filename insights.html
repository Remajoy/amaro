    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Global Pay Gap:</strong> Women still earn about 20% less than men on average worldwide. This gap is even larger in developing countries and certain sectors, reflecting ongoing discrimination and unequal access to opportunities.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Education Access:</strong> More girls attend school today than ever before, yet over 130 million girls globally are still out of school due to poverty, early marriage, or cultural norms. Education is key to empowering women and breaking the cycle of inequality.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Gender-Based Violence:</strong> One in three women worldwide experiences physical or sexual violence in their lifetime. Legal protections, social programs, and awareness campaigns are essential to reduce these numbers.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Political Representation:</strong> Women hold less than 25% of parliamentary seats worldwide. Increasing women’s participation in leadership and decision-making is vital for inclusive governance and policy that benefits everyone.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Economic and Social Impact:</strong> Empowering women improves economic growth, reduces poverty, and strengthens communities. Societies with gender equality have better education outcomes, healthier families, and stronger social cohesion.
        </li>
